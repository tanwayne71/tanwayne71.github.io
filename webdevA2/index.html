                        The grapefruit is a subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively large, sour to semi-sweet, somewhat bitter fruit. The interior flesh is segmented and varies in color from pale yellow to dark pink.

                        Grapefruit has become popular as breakfast fruit in various parts of the world, and production has expanded to most citrus-growing countries, notably the United States, Israel, Cyprus, South Africa, and Brazil.

                        The grapefruit tree grows to be as large and vigorous as an orange tree; a mature tree may be from 4.5 to 6 metres (15 to 20 feet) high. The foliage is very dense, with leaves dark and shiny green and nearly glabrous (without plant hairs). Flowers are large and white, borne singly or in clusters in the axils of the leaves. Most varieties are yellow when ripe.

                        The fruit ranges from 100 to 150 mm (4 to 6 inches) in diameter, its size depending upon the variety and upon growing conditions. Its pulp is usually light yellowish, tender, and very full of juice, with a distinctive mildly acid flavour. Several varieties have pink or red pulp.

                        Grapefruit trees produce the best quality fruit on sandy, relatively fertile soils. Supplementary fertilization is necessary in practically all producing areas. The trees come into bearing early and may be expected to produce commercially profitable crops by the fourth to sixth year after being planted in the orchard. Mature trees may produce remarkably large crops—585 to 675 kg (1,290 to 1,490 pounds) of fruit per tree.

                        Grapefruit is a citrus hybrid originating in Barbados. It is an accidental cross between the sweet orange and the pomelo or shaddock, both of which were introduced from Asia in the 17th century. It has also been called the forbidden fruit. In the past it was referred to as the pomelo, but that term is now mostly used as the common name for Citrus maxima.

                        Grapefruit originated as a natural hybrid. One ancestor of the grapefruit was the Jamaican sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), itself an ancient hybrid of Asian origin; the other was the Indonesian pomelo (C. maxima). Both C. sinensis and C. maxima were present in the West Indies by 1692. One story of the fruit's origin is that a certain "Captain Shaddock" brought pomelo seeds to Jamaica and bred the first fruit, which were then called shaddocks. This apparently referred to a captain who traded in the West Indies in the 17th century. The grapefruit then probably originated as a naturally occurring hybrid between the two plants some time after they had been introduced there.

                        In 1814, naturalist John Lunan published the term grapefruit to describe a similar Jamaican citrus plant. Lunan reported that the name was due to its similarity in taste to the grape (Vitis vinifera). An alternative explanation offered by Tussac (1824) is that this name may allude to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to bunches of grapes. After this, authors of the period used both terms forbidden fruit and grapefruit as synonyms.

                        The name grape-fruit was used more and more during the 19th century to refer to pomelos, to the consternation of some. It was brought to Florida by Count Odet Philippe in 1823, in what is now known as Safety Harbor. Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984). Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s. This led to the official name being altered to Citrus × paradisi, the × identifying its hybrid origin. An early pioneer in the American citrus industry was Kimball Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur who founded the Atwood Grapefruit Company in the late 19th century. The Atwood Grove became the largest grapefruit grove in the world, with a yearly output of 80,000 boxes of fruit. There, pink grapefruit was first discovered in 1906.

                        Raw grapefruit is 90% water, 8% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, raw grapefruit provides 33 kilocalories and is a rich source of vitamin C (40% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content. Grapefruit juice contains about half the citric acid of lime or lemon juice, and about 50% more citric acid than orange juice.

                        Grapefruit contains a healthy amount of fibre, which can reduce inflammation, prevent constipation, prevent high cholesterol, ease blood pressure, promotes healthy bacterial growth and keeps you fuller.

                        In addition to fiber, grapefruits have more in store. Grapefruits, like oranges and other citrus fruits, are high in vitamin C. In fact, one whole, medium grapefruit provides you with 100% of your daily requirement for vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that is great for your immune system and can help you fight off viruses and bacteria that can cause disease.

                        Grapefruits also have another benefit that is not shared by other citrus fruits, and that’s their high level of vitamin A, or beta carotene.
                        <br>An orange provides about 4% of the vitamin A you need, while a whole grapefruit can deliver over 50% of your requirement.
                        <br>Vitamin A is very important for eye health and, like vitamin C, supports the immune system and helps protects against inflammation.

                        A grapefruit supplies about 10% of your daily potassium needs, along with 8% of your requirements for thiamine and folate. You also get additional antioxidant power from lycopene, a natural, nutritious compound found in tomatoes and watermelon. Antioxidants help reduce wear and tear on our cells and may even help prevent serious diseases such as cancer.
